# Purpose
This repo contains the data analysis code for the study "Analyzing the Impact of Frametime Spikes on Navigation-Based Tasks in 2D Platformers."

The modified SuperTux Classic code used in this study can be found at https://github.com/nathan-anderson16/SuperTux-Classic.

# Installing
Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is recommended.

To install, run

`uv venv`

# Running
`uv run src/main.py`

# Logs
By default, logs are saved to the following locations:
- [Windows] AppData\Roaming\SuperTuxClassic\logs
- [Mac] /Library/Application Support/SuperTuxClassic/logs
- [Linux] ~/.local/share/SuperTuxClassic/logs

There are four types of logs:
- Event Logs (~/SuperTuxClassic/logs/event_logs)
    - Contain all information on in-game events and triggers
- Frame Logs (~/SuperTuxClassic/logs/frame_logs)
    - Contain frame-by-frame information 
- QoE Logs (~/SuperTuxClassic/logs/qoe_logs)
    - Contain all post round QoE survey information
- Summary Logs (~/SuperTuxClassic/logs/summary_logs)
    - Contain summaries of each round in a human-readable format

# Results Format
Logs should go in a directory called Results, in the following format:
- Results/
  - 338/
  - 339/
  - ...

## Logs
Each directory in Results corresponds to a user ID. They should contain the following files:
- The frame log (e.g. frame_log_2025-01-27_16-42-00.csv)
- The event log (e.g. event_log_2025-01-27_16-42-00.csv)
- The QoE log (e.g. qoe_log_2025-01-27_16-42-00.csv)

These logs can be copy/pasted from the logs generated by SuperTux Classic.

## Reaction Time Results
Each directory should contain the results from the user's reaction time test, renamed to USER_ID.txt, where USER_ID is the user ID (e.g. 338.txt).

An example of the contents of the file is:

259,250,160,230,0,257,223,178,190,0

0 means the user failed that round (clicked too early)

# Figures
Graphs are outputted to figures/.
